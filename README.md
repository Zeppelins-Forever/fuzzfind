# fuzznote
Perform a fuzzy search on a set of input data based (mostly) on the Levenshtein distance algorithm to get approximate matches for text strings.

This is intended to eventually morph into an application for effectively searching through large quantities of semi-structured notes, sentences, or data and giving approximate matching results without needing the specific precision of exact matching and placeholder characters such as "*" and "?". For instance, searching for a sentence may yield a set of results ranked by percentage match. This is a long ways out, however, and is simply a hobby project.
